## ⚠️ Security Note

This is a learning/demo project. Avoid using `eval` (or similar dynamic code execution) on user input in your own applications. `eval` can execute arbitrary code, which poses serious security risks. If any example code here uses `eval`, it is strictly for educational purposes—use a safe expression parser or a vetted math library in production.
