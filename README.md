# Python_Projects

A collection of Python projects demonstrating various concepts and applications. Each project is organized in its own folder with a README explaining its purpose, features, and usage.

## Projects

- **1-Encryption_Tool (CLI)**: Simple command-line encryption/decryption utilities (reference and attached variants).
- **2-Calculator (CLI)**: A command-line calculator supporting basic arithmetic operations.
- **3-Calculator (GUI)**: A Tkinter-based graphical calculator for basic math operations.
- **4-Password_Generator (CLI)**: Generates strong random passwords with customizable length and character sets.
- **5-Password_manager (Desktop-version)**: Desktop app to securely store and retrieve passwords (stores data in `data.json`).
- **6-API_Qoutes (Desktop APP)**: Desktop app that fetches and displays quotes from an API with a simple UI.

## Quick Start

Clone the repository and navigate into a project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Python_Projects.git
cd Python_Projects
```

Run any project with Python 3:

```bash
# CLI examples
python3 "1-Encryption_Tool (CLI)/Encryption_Tool.py"
python3 "2-Calculator (CLI)/Calculator.py"
python3 "4-Password_Generator (CLI)/PasswordGenetator.py"

# Desktop/GUI examples
python3 "3-Calculator (GUI)/TK_calculator.py"
python3 "5-Password_manager (Desktop-version)/main.py"
python3 "6-API_Qoutes (Desktop APP)/main.py"
```

Refer to each project's `README.md` for usage details, options, and screenshots where available.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Some projects may require additional libraries. Refer to each project's README for specific setup instructions.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. If adding a new project, include a minimal `README.md` with a short description, features, and run instructions.
